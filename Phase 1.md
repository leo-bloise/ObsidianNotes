# âœ… Phase 1 Mastery Checklist (Weeks 1â€“4)

## ðŸŸ¦ C# Language & .NET Basics
- [x] Understand basic syntax (`var`, `int`, `string`, etc.)
- [x] Use control structures (`if`, `switch`, loops)
- [x] Create and use **classes** and **objects**
- [x] Implement **interfaces** and **inheritance**
- [ ] Use **LINQ** to filter, map, and sort data
- [ ] Handle exceptions with `try`/`catch`
- [ ] Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous methods
- [ ] Understand **nullables** and null safety

## ðŸŸ¦ ASP.NET Core Minimal API
- [x] Scaffold a Minimal API using `.NET CLI` or Visual Studio
- [ ] Handle all major HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Perform model binding with route/query/body params
- [ ] Return proper responses (`Ok()`, `BadRequest()`, etc.)
- [ ] Set up and test **Swagger UI**

## ðŸŸ¦ Entity Framework Core (EF Core)
- [x] Set up `DbContext` and `DbSet<T>`
- [x] Connect to SQLite or InMemory DB
- [ ] Perform basic **CRUD** operations
- [ ] Use migrations (if working with SQLite)
- [ ] Seed initial test data

## ðŸŸ¦ Dependency Injection
- [x] Register services using `AddScoped`, `AddSingleton`, etc.
- [x] Inject services into endpoints or constructors
- [x] Know when to use each DI lifetime (Singleton vs Scoped)

## ðŸŸ¦ Tooling & Productivity

- [x] Navigate and debug using **Visual Studio** or **VS Code**
- [x] Install and manage **NuGet packages**
- [x] Use breakpoints and watches to debug C# code

## ðŸŸ¦ Data Structures & Algorithms (DS&A)
- [ ] Solve 3â€“5 Easy problems per week on LeetCode
- [ ] Master:
  - [ ] Arrays (search, reverse, duplicates)
  - [ ] Strings (palindromes, anagrams)
  - [ ] HashMaps / Dictionaries (count, lookups)
  - [ ] Two Pointers (start/end technique)
  - [ ] Sliding Window (max sum, subarrays)

## ðŸŸ¦ Project 1: Task Manager API
- [x] Set up a working ASP.NET Core Minimal API
- [ ] Implement CRUD endpoints for tasks
- [ ] Use EF Core to persist tasks
- [ ] Validate input (e.g., empty task names)
- [ ] Add Swagger documentation
- [ ] Push to GitHub with a clean README

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Review
Before moving to Phase 2:
- [ ] I can build and test a complete Minimal API
- [ ] I understand the C# language fundamentals
- [ ] I can perform database operations using EF Core
- [ ] Iâ€™m confident solving easy DS&A problems
- [ ] Iâ€™ve published at least **one solid project** on GitHub
