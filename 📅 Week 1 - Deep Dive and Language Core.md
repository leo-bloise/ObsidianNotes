## 🛠️ Projects & Tasks

### 📌 Mini Project: Console ToDo App

Build a basic ToDo list app with the following features:

- [ ] Add, list, and remove tasks
- [ ] Save/load tasks from a `.txt` file
- [ ] Filter completed vs pending tasks using LINQ

**Optional**: Add task deadlines and sort by date

## 💻 Leetcode Practice (C#)

**Daily** (30–45 min):
- [ ] Easy problems: arrays, strings, hash maps
- [ ] Goal: Solve 5–6 problems this week using C#

## 🌍 English Practice

### Listening:
- [ ] Watch 1–2 short videos on C# fundamentals  
  Suggested: *“C# for Beginners”* (Microsoft Learn or Nick Chapsas)

### Writing:
- [ ] Keep a small learning journal in English  
  Prompt: “What did I learn in C# today?”

### Speaking:
- [ ] Try to explain a C# concept (like OOP) out loud in English for 2 minutes
