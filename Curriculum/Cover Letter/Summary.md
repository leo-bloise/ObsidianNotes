Basically, the guide is pretty useful to highlight the important parts, but not all companies read the cover letter. Here's what I've digested about it:

- Always use the business language. If you don't know the language, read the description and use the same terms and phrase construction. It's a good way of emulating it.
- We have two sections: stuff I need to do in this position and what they're looking for. The first ones are the most important while the last ones tend to be less important.
